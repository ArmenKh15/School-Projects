Finding Mesas
To be clear, all programming assignments in this class are individual assignments.

In this assignment, you are tasked with using structs and dynamic memory to find Mesas within a set of integers. 

(This spec is long, and we recognize that. However, we attempted to answer a lot of questions that may come up
within the spec. Please try to find the answers to your questions in here before asking.)

What is a Mesa?
A mesa is defined in the following way:

Given a set of non-negative integers, a mesa is a sequence of at least a given minimum identical values. The 
length of a mesa is the number of values in the sequence, and the mass of a mesa is the sum of the values in the sequence.

The first number in the dataset is the number of values to follow on that line. In the example below, the 
first number is 80, so there are 80 values following. The numbers highlighted in blue are on their own line. 
They represent the minimum length and minimum height of a valid Mesa in this set of data. In other words, 
there must be at least 34 of the same number in a row and that number must be at least 546 for a Mesa to be 
considered valid in this set of data.
