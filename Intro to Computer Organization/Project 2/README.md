ALLOWED OPERATORS

The bits.c file contains a skeleton for each of the 4 programming puzzles. 
Your assignment is to complete each function skeleton using only straightline 
code for the integer puzzles (i.e., no loops or conditionals) and a limited number 
of C arithmetic and logical operators. Specifically, you are only allowed to use the following eight operators:

 ! ~ & ^ | + << >>
 
A few of the functions further restrict this list.

 

ALLOWED CONSTANTS

You are not allowed to use any constants longer than 8 bits. For example, using 0xAF or 213 
in your code is fine because those values can be represented in 8 bits or fewer. However, 
using 0x12345 or 918 or -386 are invalid because those values take more than 8 bits to represent. 
(Note that -386 is invalid both because it is longer than 8 bits AND because it uses a negative sign 
which is not one of the valid operators.)
